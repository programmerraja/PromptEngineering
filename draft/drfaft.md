How to choose model

- have golde data set and test with all model and see how before choose technialca like context window temp etc..

use https://lmarena.ai/ to find model

- how to choose model ?

Have set of prompt to test the model when new model came are you want to find out that will suitable etc have
dataset to test.

added feature in prompt eval to add custom api and key etcs

- A Systematic Survey of Automatic Prompt Optimization Techniques

These surveys identify approximately 100+ distinct APO techniques, yet most fall into five categories: foundation model-based optimization (using LLMs as optimizers), evolutionary algorithms, gradient-based methods, reinforcement learning, and bandit-based approaches. The optimization-theoretic lens enables principled selection of methods based on problem structure and computational budget.
