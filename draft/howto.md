1. **Get to the Point**
   - Avoid long, meandering intros.
   - Answer two questions quickly:
     1. Is this for someone like me?
     2. What will I gain from reading it?

2. **Think One Degree Bigger**
   - Broaden your audience where possible.
   - Small tweaks (simplifying jargon, adding context) can expand reach significantly.

3. **Plan the Route to Your Readers**
   - Don’t assume Google will rank your post highly.
   - Research where your target audience hangs out (Hacker News, Reddit, niche forums).
   - Choose topics with clear distribution paths.

4. **Show More Pictures**

   - Break up text-heavy content with relevant images, graphs, and diagrams.
   - Even simple sketches or screenshots improve readability.

5. **Accommodate Skimmers**

   - Use clear headings, bullet points, and images to make content easy to scan.
   - A well-structured article will attract and retain more readers.

By following these principles, bloggers can significantly improve the chances of their posts gaining traction.
