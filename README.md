# PromptEngineering

This is my new series on Prompt Engineering and it's different from everything else out there.

Most blogs give you templates: "Try this prompt!" or "Use these 10 techniques!" That's not what we're doing here.

We're going deep: **How do LLMs actually process your prompts? What makes a prompt effective at the mechanical level? Where do LLMs fail and why?**

This series will give you the mental models to engineer prompts yourself, not just copy someone else's examples. Let's dive in.

We going to have 4 parts (so far I think but may be in future we add more )

- **The Foundation - How LLMs Really Work**
- **The Art & Science of Prompting**
- **Boundaries, Limits, and Practical Mastery**
- **Tips and Tricks**
